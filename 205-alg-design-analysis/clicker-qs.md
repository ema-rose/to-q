- B) 1. --  The answer is one because you don't have to traverse the list like with a linked list.    
- A) True. -- I got this wrong, I looked in the `changes` array, rather than the `where` array. It was actually False.    
- B) False  --  This is because `where` sub 2 returns 6, then looking at `changes` sub 6 gives us 0. Thus, no changes.    
- B) False. --  `Changes` sub 0 is greater than the `num_changes`, so it can't be true.

- I originally choose A) 7.
 However, this is incorrect. The
 correct answer is 15.
 A Binary Tree with a height of 3
 uses the equation 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2+0
 to return the total number of nodes.
 2^3 = 8, 2^2 = 4, 2^1 = 2, 2^0 = 1,
 which all together = 15.
 Thus, we have a total of 15 nodes.
